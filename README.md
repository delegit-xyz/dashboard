# Delegate, eat, sleep

The easiest way to delegate on Polkadot

## Delegation made simple
- 2 click flow to delegate, even with complex setup
- See your current governance locks
- Delegatees can link to their page direction

### Why
Elections are only meaningful if the participation turnout is high.
This applies to politics around the world, and to Polkadot.

To increase turnout (1-3% currently) we need more participation, which leads to more decentralization
Delegation is a way to give power to delegatees, that can vote on your behalf.
