During this time we have co-organised more than [30 Polkadot meetup](https://www.meetup.com/polkadot-hungary/), [2 Polkadot Championship Hackathon](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/hackers-wanted-for-polkadots-36k-metaverse-championship-anyone-welcome/) and the biggest on-site event of Budapest Blockchain Week, Polkadot Day. Our community was started by Six, the regional Head Ambassador and we are now the most active crypto/blockhain community in Hungary in terms of event organization and [Telegram group](https://t.me/polkadothungary/) activity. Our main motivation is community organization and community education on how to use the Polkadot ecosystem, so we provide them with news, videos and informative articles.\nOur community is shaping the evolution of the Polkadot Network. We have launched the Polkadot Hungary Staking Pool with Pool ID 219, and actively participate in Polkadot's on-chain governance system, OpenGov, with our expertise. Votes are determined by community voting and are cast via a multisignature account.\n\n## 🇭🇺 A közösségünkről\n  A Polkadot Hungary Community 2020 óta töretlenül szervezi a lokális Polkadot közösséget. Ez idő alatt több, mint [30 Polkadot Meetup-ot](https://www.meetup.com/polkadot-hungary/), [2 Polkadot Championship Hackathon-t](https://cointelegraph.com/press-releases/hackers-wanted-for-polkadots-36k-metaverse-championship-anyone-welcome/) és a budapesti Blockchain Week legnagyobb eseményét, a Polkadot Day-t szervezezte meg. Közösségünket Six, a regionális Head Ambassador indította el és mára már a legaktívabb crypto/blokklánc közösség vagyunk Magyarországon esemény szervezés és [Telegram csoport](https://t.me/polkadothungary/) aktivitás alapján. Fő motivációnk a közösségszervezés az edukáció a Polkadot ökoszisztéma használatára, így ellátjuk őket hírekkel, videókkal és informatív cikkekkel.\nKözösségünk formálja a Polkadot Network alakulását. A 219-es Pool ID-val elindítottuk a Polkadot Hungary Staking Pool-t, valamint szakértelmünkkel aktívan részt veszünk a Polkadot on-chain governance rendszerében, OpenGov-on. A referendumokra közösségi elbírálás után szavazunk a Polkadot Hungary Community multisig tárcájával.\n\n![Polkadot Hungary Community logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nova-wallet/opengov-delegate-registry/master/images/logo_phc.png)",
